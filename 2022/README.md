# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022

Happy Holidays!

My solutions to [Eric's](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) wonderful [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2022. 

I'm trying to use Python and complete each dayâ€™s problem in a ~~ 30 minute ~~
one hour timeframe. I'm recording my attempts[^1] with the idea of trying to better
understand where I can enhance or speed up my iteration / development workflow.

Videos are [Here](http://jef.ro/aoc/) if you're interested.


[^1]: This was suggested by the fine folks at
  [DUTC](https://www.dontusethiscode.com/) during their Code Review class. I
  highly recommend their classes if you want to deepen your understanding of
  programing.
